## Roadmap

- Editor update/rewrite
- Custom widget development (you will like make your own widgets and stuff)
- Better performance and faster load times on ntp.
- More unified options, so like all widgets with text can just import something and have the options auto-populate and apply. this would lwk be lit so I don't have to repeat so much code

## Contributing

contributions aren't expected, but are welcome. This codebase is weird, but I think you should be able to manage if you look around hard enough, though names might not be self-explanatory.
